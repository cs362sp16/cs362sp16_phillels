When the steward card is played through cardEffect, instead of two additional cards being drawn, only one is. This can be verified by checking the size of the playerâ€™s deck before steward is played and after. It should be decremented by two, but it is only decremented by one. This is a low severity, moderate priority bug because while this bug only effects one card, having the additional new card in the hand could significantly alter the result of the game by giving someone the opportunity to play a card they would really need.
