When the steward card is played through cardEffect, only one card is discarded instead of two. This can be verified by checking the size of the playerâ€™s discard before steward is played and after. It should be incremented by 2, but it is only incremented by one. This is a low severity, low priority bug because this bug only effects one card, and it matches the number of cards being added, so it does not significantly impact the flow of the game.
