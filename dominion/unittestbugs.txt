Bugs found:

In cardtest3.c I was testing the seahag card. I discovered that it decrements deck and put a curse card on top, but it replaces the top card with curse, and the former top card is not pushed further back into the deck.

In cardtest4.c I was testing the great hall card. I identified that the pointer types were incorrect and were affecting the functionality of the card.
