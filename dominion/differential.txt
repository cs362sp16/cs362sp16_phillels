I discovered a difference how cards were arranged in the playerâ€™s decks. It is not easy to decide who is correct.This is not a good case for differential testing because we are both working from the same very flawed code base and only make relatively minor changes. I was able to get 60% code coverage on the implementations. I noticed that for some reason that later cards were never being bought, which significantly impacted the code covered.
